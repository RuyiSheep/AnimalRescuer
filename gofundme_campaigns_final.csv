My heart is breaking right now. My sweet cat Fiona Apple hasn’t been doing well — she stopped eating, lost a lot of weight really quickly, and has been struggling just to get through the day. I took her to the vet, and they told me there’s a chance she may have cancer.

Right now, we’re still in the process of getting a full diagnosis — she needs more tests and scans as soon as possible so we can figure out what’s really going on and how to treat it. The costs are already over",16

Our little Simone (or “Mony” for short; if you met her, you’d know she’s much more a Mony than a Simone) has been diagnosed with a form of feline cancer.

Am Felicia, my furbaby needs surgery. He has a lump/mass on his right groin. He already had bloodwork and a biopsy. Next step is surgery to remove the mass.
I love this little guy to the moon and back. He is my psychiatric service dog. Comforts me during stressful moments, wakes me up if I have nightmares, helps me overcome depressive episodes and anxiety.
He is the best thing that has happened to me.
Any monies above the vet costs will go to an animal charity.

She was doing her best for them, but she was too sick to care for them or herself. The house is hardly appropriate living quarters—no central heat or AC, mold growing over unattended litter boxes, and no one to interact with the c",7

Hi everyone, my name is Andrew, and earlier today (10/21/26) I found a small kitten trying to cross the Boulevard at Grant Avenue in Northeast Philadelphia.

I brought him home, gave him food, water, and a gentle bath. He’s very timid but has such a sweet temperament for everything he’s been through. He’s still alert and responsive,",5

Hi Friends. Unfortunately, the worst has happened for my sweet Oliver pig and his companions. They were viciously attacked by what we think was a loose dog or dogs while in their barn.

I found this poor baby tied up behind an abandoned house. She was used to breed, and they took her babies and left her to die. She is severely starved, and rescue places are either at max capacity or want to put her down. Any donations would help to get her the vet care she needs and get her all healthy again!!

Hello everyone, I usually never ask for help, but today I got the news that my 2-year-old puppy will need surgery and I won’t be able to afford it without help. Whatever you can donate is appreciated. The surgery is to correct her lady parts so she won’t get bladder infections so often like now. Anything is appreciated, and thank you in advance. She is the light of our lives and the reason that our family smiles every day.

My ESA, Loki, whom I’ve had for 8 years, was unfortunately diagnosed with FIP (Feline Infectious Peritonitis). This rare disease occurs when a cat contracts the coronavirus and it mutates into a deadly form.

Today’s the Day — October 18th, 2025
Today is a very unique day — it’s the day the auction happens.

For many of these dogs, this is their last chance. They’re sold for as little as $1 to $10, often with serious medical issues or extreme fear. But today, we step in.

These dogs will need everything — funding, fosters, medical care, and most importantly, love. Many will come in just like Pongo did: scared, shut down, and unsure of what human kindness feels like. Their first rea",8

My dog of 13 years sadly passed away on October 21, 2025, unexpectedly. He was my right-hand man and one of my mother's best friends. I gave him a great 13 years of his life and had him since he was a puppy. We are heartbroken by his passing and were not expecting this, as most people wouldn't.

Hi everyone,

I really don’t like asking for help, but right now I don’t have another choice. My cat, Pacho, needs surgery, and I can’t afford it on my own.

She’s been with me since I was 14 years old. I’m 23 now, and she’s been by my side through everything. She was there for me when my dad passed away from cancer earlier this year, through every hard day, every late night, every moment I needed comfort. She’s my best friend and my family.

Help Tiny and Slick Get the Medical Care They Deserve

For over 15 years, we’ve been dedicated to a TNR (Trap-Neuter-Return) program supporting community cats in our local industrial park. Thanks to a small group of volunteers and kindhearted feeders, these cats are fed, monitored, and cared for every single day.

Recently, two of our cats – Tiny and Slick – needed emergency medical care beyond what our small group can handle.

She is referring us to a specialist, but they’re located 3 hours away in New Orleans. We asked for a short-term option, and the vet s",4

Our dog Sadie — a 9-year-old pit bull mix — was recently diagnosed with an aggressive, high-grade mast cell tumor on her rear leg.

We had surgery to remove the mass and the closest lymph node. At the time, we didn’t know how severe the tumor was — those answers only come after testing. The results were devastating: a high-grade mast cell tumor with a mitotic index of 11, meaning the cancer is very active and fast-growing. There were also cancer cells in the margins of the tum",12

Please help me fund Cooper's emergency surgery. We were just quoted $5,000 (not including the near $700 just spent at his primary vet). We have put down the $3,000 deposit and he is in surgery now.

If you know me, you know Cooper. This dog means the world to me, my family, and my son. I cannot imagine what we would do without him.

I hate to do this, but we just finished paying off his procedure from the summer. Anything helps and from the bottom of my heart, thank you. ❤️

My sweet boy Barin has recently been diagnosed with hyperthyroidism - his thyroid gland works too hard, producing too many hormones. At first, doctors couldn’t find the cause, and we lost precious time. Later, he was put on medication, but sadly, it’s on",3

This tiny girl showed up outside my friend’s work—barely eight weeks old, covered in mud, and crying her little head off. I took her home, gave her a warm bath, and quickly realized things were worse than they looked.

She’s got multiple wounds on her front leg, under her chin, and around her neck. When I took her to the vet this morning, the diagnosis just about broke me:
• Maggots in the wounds
• Possible infection
• Dehydration
• Possible broken or dislocated leg

Leo is a sweet, loving cat who means the world to us, but he’s facing a serious injury that requires urgent surgery to save his leg. Without it, he could lose his ability to walk and play like he used to. We’re doing everything we can, but the cost of the procedure is more than we can manage on our own. Any donation—no matter how small—will go directly toward Leo’s surgery and recovery. Your kindness could give him the chance to live a full, happy life again.

The vet gave me a treatment plan but it’s way more than I can afford right now. I don’t want to give up on her",45

Hello hello

I’m reaching out with a heavy heart to ask for help. My retired service dog, Spyro, is going in for his second abdominal surgery due to a bowel obstruction. The cost is overwhelming, and I’m doing everything I can to make sure he gets the care he needs.

Spyro isn’t just a pet — he’s my hero. He spent years by my side as a trained service dog, helping me with mobility and cardiac alert. Though he’s now retired and I no longer rely on him like I used to, he needs m",6

Willow and Wisp are a sister and brother duo rescued from the Bronx after their mom left and never returned, leaving them out in the cold crying with hunger, before being taken in by a school principal, who brought them to school with her to make sure they received round-the-clock care until a suitable foster was found!

Normally, the babies are lively, screaming for their bottle every four hours, and running around their makeshift bathtub nursery. However, when they stopped e",6

Every day, healthy, loving dogs are euthanized in Texas simply because there’s not enough space or support. In 2021 alone, more than 61,000 dogs and cats were killed in Texas shelters… the highest number in the nation. It’s devastating… but we can change it. We’re raising funds for Austin Pets Alive, one of the country’s most inspiring no-kill shelters. When they started, Austin’s euthanasia rate was 87%. Today, it’s less than 3%. That’s what compassion and community can do. Our g",2

Hello, my name is Amy with Schnauzer Rescue Cincinnati. The rescue recently received a plea for assistance with 3 bonded Schnauzers. With rescues being extremely full, the difficulty for 3 bonded pups is even more challenging. Splitting seniors and removing them from their homes and each other is just not what we want to do.

SRC, along with Schnauzies in Need, would like to assist by creating and sharing a fundraiser to keep this family together.

Please know this is not a fu",6

Help Save Brook – My Sweet Girl Is Fighting for Her Life ❤️

Hi, my name is Dylan, and I’m humbly asking for help to save my best friend, Brook.

I adopted Brook a little over a year ago after she was rescued in the middle of winter with frostbite. She had been abandoned and was used for breeding and suffered a lot of other forms of abuse. From the moment I brought her home, she became my whole world, my sidekick, my comfort, and a true part of me. We do everything together, a",2

I came across this poor sweet boy in such rough shape today It was completely unexpected, but I just couldn’t walk away. He’s covered in sores, missing patches of fur, and clearly has been through so much — yet he’s still so gentle, loving, and hopeful.

Right now, I’m doing everything I can to get him the vet care, medication, good food, and comfort he desperately needs to heal and finally feel safe again. Any donation, no matter how small, will go directly toward his medical",7

Meet Skraggy, a sweet old soul who needs help right now. He showed up at our house asking for help. He's currently living outside and winter is on its way. His current condition is heartbreaking. He has a wonky ear, possibly ear mites or an infection, needs to be neutered, and given a full vet work-up. I've taken on the responsibility to tame him and possibly make him an inside cat. Unfortunately, the cost is steep for vet care. With your help, we can ensure Skraggy makes a re",10

Meet our beautiful little girl, Zelda. We adopted her ten years ago. She had been in the shelter for almost two years with little interest because she was shy and doesn't like to be picked up. She followed me around as I spoke to all the kitties, and my husband said she chose us. With love and patience, we brought her out of her shell. She is our precious little angel and the perfect companion to her more rambunctious brother, Rodney.

Jessica Elwell passed away on October 12, 2025. She had a very loving soul, and would volunteer often. One of her major loves in life was animals, and one of the places she volunteered was Cheyenne Mountain Zoo.

Jessica was a kind and caring soul whose passions reflected her vibrant spirit. She had a deep love for animals and found joy in both taking care of and spending time with them. She often volunteered her personal time to ensure the well-being of any animal she could. ",2
